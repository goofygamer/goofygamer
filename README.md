### :woman_technologist: About Me:

I am pursuing my Master's in FinMath from UChicago and **actively pursuing opportunities in the field of Quant Research and Development**. Prior to that, I graduated with a Econ + Math degree from UNCW.

- For the last two years, I worked as a Macroeconomic Researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
- I had a wide range of responsibilities at the Fed including simulation modeling, stochastic and markov processes, low-level optimization, and data manipulation for extremely large datasets.
- Currently, I am utilizing my time learning data structure concepts and implementing them through various projects.

- How to reach me: [![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sankalp_Yadav-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sankalp-yadav/) or [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Website-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=GoogleChrome&logoColor=white)](https://www.sankalp-yadav.com/)
